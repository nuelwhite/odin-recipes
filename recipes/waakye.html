    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Waakye is a popular Ghanaian dish made from rice and beans, often served with a variety of sides such as boiled eggs, fried plantains, spaghetti, gari, and shito (spicy sauce).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups rice</li>
        <li>1 cup black-eyed peas or red beans</li>
        <li>1-2 dried millet leaves (optional, for color)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the beans in water for a few hours or overnight for faster cooking.</li>
        <li>Rinse the beans and place them in a pot. Add enough water to cover and cook until they begin to soften (about 20-30 minutes).</li>
        <li>If using millet leaves, add them to the pot for the traditional waakye color.</li>
        <li>Rinse the rice and add it to the beans. Add more water if needed to cook both rice and beans together.</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste. Stir occasionally and cook until both rice and beans are soft and water is absorbed (about 20-30 minutes).</li>
        <li>Remove millet leaves before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with your choice of sides: boiled eggs, fried plantains, spaghetti, gari, shito, salad, or meat/fish.</li>
    </ol>
