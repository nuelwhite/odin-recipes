    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Banku is a traditional Ghanaian dish made from fermented corn and cassava dough, cooked into a smooth, elastic dough. It is commonly served with okro soup, pepper sauce, or soup and fish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>2 cups corn dough</li>
        <li>1 cup cassava dough</li>
        <li>Water (as needed)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
